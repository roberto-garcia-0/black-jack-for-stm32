# Project Overview:
This GitHub repository hosts the source code for a real-time Blackjack game implemented on the STM32 microcontroller platform. The game allows players to experience the classic card game of Blackjack against a virtual dealer, making use of the STM32's capabilities for user interaction and display.

## Key Features:

- Blackjack Game: Play a game of Blackjack against a virtual dealer with graphical card animations and real-time scoring.
- Interactive User Interface: Utilize the STM32's LCD screen and joystick for a dynamic and user-friendly gaming experience.
- Randomized Card Dealing: Cards are dealt randomly to ensure an authentic gaming experience.
- Betting System: Place bets and manage your balance within the game.
- Real-Time Scoring: Keep track of your score and monitor the dealer's hand.
- Game Logic: The code includes the core logic of Blackjack, handling player actions, card counting, and determining the winner.

## Hardware Requirements:

- STM32 microcontroller (specifically STM32L476xx)
- Joystick for user input
- An SPI LCD screen for displaying game elements

## How to Play:

- Initialize your balance.
- Place your bets.
- Receive your initial hand and decide whether to hit, stand, double down, or surrender.
- Play against the dealer and aim to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
- Win by having a higher hand value than the dealer without busting.
- Enjoy an engaging and interactive gaming experience on the STM32 platform.

Note: This project provides a foundation for implementing more advanced features and user interactions in future iterations.
